This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of flowers into five categories: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The Python script uses libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and others for image processing and machine learning. The dataset, containing images of different flower types, is preprocessed and augmented to enhance model training. The CNN architecture includes several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification. After training the model with augmented data, it achieves a test accuracy of approximately 71.65% on the validation set. The project highlights the use of deep learning techniques in image recognition tasks.

The provided code is an Arduino sketch that integrates the Edge Impulse machine learning inference engine for audio processing.It utilizes a microphone to collect
audio data, processes this data with a pre-trained model, and performs actions based on the inference results.Key components include the Edge Impulse Ingestion SDK, dynamic
and static memory management for handling model data, and the PDM library for audio data capture. The program's main loop records audio, runs model inference, 
and controls an LED based on the prediction outcomes. This setup is designed for real-time audio analysis applications like sound classification or voice command 
recognition, making it ideal for embedded systems requiring on-device processing.
